# xorwasm

WebAssembly shellcoding challenge.

Accessible via port 9999.

Our competitors created a new OTP computation that they say is difficult to break. However, we have access to the interface that loads the WebAssembly process. It's possible to submit our own WebAssembly and have their server run it.
