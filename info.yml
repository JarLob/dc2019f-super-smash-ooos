# Test scripts are heavily encouraged.
# All scripts should exit 0 if nothing went wrong.
# Scripts are automatically determined to be exploit scripts if they start with the word "exploit".
# Exploit scripts must output the flag using "FLAG: <FLAG>" and exit with 0 if the flag was captured correctly.

# These local test scripts are run inside of a "local interaction" docker container that is derived from the service container.
# They are for running more hardcore tests (i.e., static analysis, etc).
